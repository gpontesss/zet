+ Ps. 89:24: The Messiah would be strengthened by Jehovah's Name.
+ Ps. 89:8-9: The Psalm says only Jehovah is powerful, and uses His control over
    the waters and the sea as a proof of His power. Christ, in the gospels, is
    the one who calms down the sea, and, in response, the disciples worship Him.
