# Managing a lean startup

Traditional administration and planning doesn't work in a startup due to its
essence: a startup operates on uncertain ground. While traditional processes
propose a rigid product and strategy, startups should always be _calibrating_
its products based on _feedback_ from its users and business metrics.

Though its product and strategy should change, these always do to follow a
fixed principle, which is its driving _vision_. This should rarely change and
must be the guiding force for strategies and products. This can be illustrated
by a pyramid, where what's nearest the top is the most fluid.
