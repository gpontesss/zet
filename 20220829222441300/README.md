# The Paradise of Apo. 2:7 is in Heaven

> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him
> who overcomes, I will give to eat from the tree of life, which is in the midst
> of the Paradise of God.

Those who win go to Paradise, to eat the tree of life. Paul says that this
Paradise is in the 3rd Heaven. (2 Cor. 12:2-4.) When talking to the thief on the
Cross, Christ says that he'll be with _Him_ in Paradise. (Luke 23:43.) Christ's
message was directed to the "anointed" Christians of the 1st century, which had
the "heavenly hope". Furthermore, Christ makes no qualification other than: "he
who overcomes". (OSB.)

The "trees of life" appear again in the Heavenly city (Apo. 22:2.), for the care
of the nations. Apo. 21:27 says that those written in the book of life are the
ones who can enter the city.
