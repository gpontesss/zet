# Paul talks about two groups within the Christian community

Ephesians 2 talks about two groups: jews and gentiles. They form a unique body.
(v. 16) They are sons, just as the "anointed". (v. 19) They are a Temple to
God, where He inhabits through the Spirit. (v. 21-22) There's only a single
Gospel for both. (v. 17) Further in the letter, in Eph. 4:4, Paul makes it
clear that there's only a single hope.
