+ Ps. 89:24: The Messiah would be strengthened by Jehovah's Name.
+ Ps. 89:8-9: The Psalm says only Jehovah is powerful, and uses His control over
    the waters and the sea as a proof of His power. Christ, in the gospels, is
    the one who calms down the sea, and, in response, the disciples worship Him.
+ The Bible uses the "plural of majesty" when talking about God, e.g., when it
    uses "Elohim". It's interesting to note that other languages also do this,
    e.g., German uses the form "Sie" as a pronoun used to refer to respected
    people, like elders etc. "Sie" is also the plural, when you refer to
    multiple persons, i.e., the equivalent of "they" in english.
