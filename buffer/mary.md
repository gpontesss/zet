# Buffer notes on Mary

+ Mary is the New Eve. Eve is called the "Living one", but is truly Mary who
    gives birth to Christ, the Living One (Apo. ref), the Life (John 14) etc.
+ Mary follows the Divine hierarchy, instead of Eve, who went and ate of the
    fruit with Adam's consent. (Though he sinned, anyway.) Mary starts Christ's
    ministry by implicitly asking of Him to get wine to the party.
    + Christ calls her "woman", which is a reference to the original woman, Eve.
