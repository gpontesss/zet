# Buffer notes on Wisdom

+ Prov. 1:20-23: Wisdom says it will pour out Her Spirit. Compare with Joel,
    where _God_ says He'll pour His Spirit.
+ Wisdom of Sirach says that its Throne the pillars of clouds, just as Yahweh's,
    and Christ's.
+ Luke 11:49 and Mat. 23:34: Christ identifies Himself as the Wisdom of God. Is
    it a quatation of the apocrypha?
+ 1 Cor. 1:24: Paul identifies Christ as the Wisdom of God. He also calls Christ
    the power of God. (Interesting parallel with Rom. 1:20 to say Christ is
    Eternal.)
