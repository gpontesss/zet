# Buffer notes on the trinity

+ Isa. 48:16: Yahweh says that Yahweh sent Himself and His Spirit.
+ Zec. 12:10: Yahweh says He's the one pierced. (John 19:37 quotes it.)
    + WT's "Question of the readers" article on this verse:
        https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1953608#h=1:0-9:0
+ 2 Cor. 6:16: Citation of the OT: "I will _dwell_ in them and _walk_ among
    them". This seems to be a direct reference to the Trinity: Christ is "God
    among us" (Isa. 7, "He will be called Emmanuel"; Mat. 1:23.), who _walked_
    on Earth, and the Spirit is Who makes us a living Temple to God, _dwelling_
    in us. (1 Cor. 3:16.) [[there'll probably be a related note until then.]]
+ Mark 1:23-24: [TODO: take the parallel gospel passages.] The unclean spirit
    (note, in the singular.) says in the plural: "what have _we_ to do with
    You". There's that principle of unity and multiplicity. This makes me
    wonder: is this a thing that happens in the spiritual realm? If so, that
    makes the Trinity not one of a kind in terms of one being three, etc.
