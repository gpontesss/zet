# Buffer notes on the Kingdom

+ 1 Cor. 4:18-19: Paul makes it clear that the Kingdom of God was reigning back
    then. The Kingdom is "power" which is increased in grace, rather than words.
    Thus, not a government like the ones on Earth, but the reigning of God in
    the Heart of every Christian by His grace.
