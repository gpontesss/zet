# Christ is the "reflection" of God's Glory

Heb. 1:3 states that Christ:

1. Is the reflection of God's Glory;
2. Is the express image of His --- the Father's --- person;
3. Upholds the all things by the word of His power.

The Church Fathers compare the first statement with the "sun irradiating light".
Light emitted by the sun is of the of the same nature of the sun itself. Thus,
the Nicene Creed states that the Son is "Light from Light". Being of the same
nature as the Father, they are consubstancial, and, thus, says the Nicene Creed:
"Very God from Very God". This is also a statement of the necessity, e.g.,
non-contigency, of the Son: the sun cannot exist without radiating light, and
the Father couldn't be a father without the Son. Both of Them exist from all
Eternity and are uncreated --- which means non-contingent.

The second statemant makes clear the distinction that exists within the Trinity:
Father and Son are different Persons. Yet, the Son is the exact representation
(as the NWT says) of the Father, which means He can't be a simple creature.
(Col. 1:15 says, accordingly, that He is "the image of the invisible God".) The
Father, by nature, is an infinite Being. No creature can be infinite like the
Father. No son of God can be compared to Him, (Ps. 89:6-7.) only Christ. And
this is why when the disciples saw Christ, they saw the Father. (John 14:6-9.)
No angel could state the same as the Son. And this is why in Him "the wholeness
of Divinity dwells bodily". (Col. 2:9.)

The third statement shows that Christ has the same power as His Father, and it
was not granted to Him, but it's part of His nature. John 1:1-3 states that
Christ created _all_ things, and not a single thing was created _apart_ from
Him. He was there in the beginning with the Father, (v. 1) as His Word, thus His
power precedes the Incarnation. Col. 1:16-17 is a related verse that exaustively
makes it clear that every single thing --- not even one missing --- was created
by the uncreated Christ. Also, when Paul says He 'upholds all things by the
power of His word', once again it states His Divinity and the synergy between
the Three Divine Persons: it is said that God created things through His word.
(Gen. 1:3; Ps. 33:6.) Christ states that does everything the Father does. (John
14:19.) Thus He can claim to be God and to sustain all things by the "word of
His power".
