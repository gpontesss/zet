# "He who overcomes" is a "pillar" in the Temple (Apo. 3:12.)

"To him who overcomes" is a conceded to be a pillar on the Temple of God. To be
a pillar indicates an integral part.[^1] These of the "great crowd" of Apo. 7
serve in the Temple "day and night". (Apo. 7:15.) These render "sacred service",
just as the Lord's "slaves" of Apo. 22:3, who are in the Heavenly City and will
see the face of God (v. 4). "The face of God" is an expression often used to
refer to Christ, [[...]] thus making it clear that these "slaves" are in union
with the lamb, just as the hope for the "anointed". These have the Name of God,
of the City and of the Lamb written in their forehead, just as the "slaves" who
redner sacred service (Apo. 22:3-4. They have the name of the Lamb written in
their forehead.); as the 144.000 in mount Zion, who are alongside the Lamb.
(Apo. 14:1. Both the name of the Fathe rand of the SOn are written in their
forehead.)
