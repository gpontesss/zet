# Typological stories as latter story developments

Reading Robert Alter's entry on Wikipedia, I came across a theory of his about
typological stories in the Bible:

> One of Alter's important contributions is the introduction of the type scene
> into contemporary scholarly Hebrew Bible studies. An example of a type scene
> is that of a man meeting a young woman at a well, whom he goes on to marry;
> this scene occurs twice in Genesis and once in Exodus, and, according to
> Alter, distortedly in 1 Samuel and in the Book of Ruth.[^1]

This is something that crossed my mind a while ago: ancient stories are
typically enhanced in some way, or polished, after a long time. Through oral
narration, things are added, subtracted, changed, until it reaches a stable
state. It isn't done with a malicius intent. Often things change to better
accomodate symbology, to able to communicate universal ideas in each one. Real
stories are complicated and full of details that not always fit the poetic
_phronema_.

If this is true about the OT, (various typological stories are present in
Genesis alone, being repeated in more than one passage.) why couldn't this be
true about other accounts, e.g., as it's often argued to be the case of Mary?
The difference is that the NT was written in a time where the stories had not
yet been fully developed, so it's possible to see some discrepancies between
them. (That's not to argue, though, that they weren't there at all. Luke seems
to be a special writter that pays important attention to her and attributes
types of the OT to her in that early stage.) This is an argument against
fundamentalists that, for certain, wouldn't doubt these OT accounts, but would
doubt some teachings of the Church that are only well-described outside of the
NT canon, even if in the 2nd century, very close to the apostolic teachers.

This is not to favor liberal scholarship, but I think some of the things being
argued are true. That being, there are two options: to deny what is said, or to
understand that it's part of how things naturally evolved, and that it's not a
problem, but, rather, a refinement that gets rid of unimportant details and
preserves the trully useful themes of such stories.
