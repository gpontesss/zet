# The Lord's Day of Apo. 1:10 is the Sunday of Worship

> I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice. as
> of a trumpet (OSB)

Apo. 1:10 contains the earliest reference to the term "Lord's Day" refering to
the Christian name for Sunday.[^1] Other early Christian documents also use it
to refer to Sunday, the day people gathered to celebrate the Resurrection in the
Holy Eucharist, e.g., the Didache and Ignatius of Antioch. [[...]]

The expression "the Lord's Day" is also used to refer to Christ's second coming.
[[...]] This is not the case in John's Apocalpyse for in Apo. 1:19 Christ makes
clear that what John sees refer to "things which are", and to "things which will
take pplace after this". Thus, part of what is seen occurs in the time that John
is living, so it can't be a vision exclusively of the second coming of Christ,
since it has not yet happened.
