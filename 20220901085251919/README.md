# Isa. 61 testifies Christ as the Messiah and the New Covenant

Isaiah 61 prophecies the coming of the Messiah. v.1 says: "the Spirit of the
Sovereign Lord Yahweh will be upon me". This was accomplished in Christ's
baptism. (Mat. 3:16.) The verse also uses the verb "to anoint", which is where
the term "Messiah" ("The Chosen") comes from.

The Messiah is sent for a variety of purposes. vv. 1-3 seem to be what is being
referred in the Sermon on the Mount, in Mat. 5, where Christ was openly
revealing that He was the Messiah.

Christ, before His death, institutes a New Covenant with His disciples, of a
Kingdom. (Luke 22:28-29.) Isa. says the this Covenant will be an everlasting
one. (v. 8.) This was said directed to the jews. (vv. 5-6 seems to make a
constrast with the "nations".) The fulfilling of this, in the NT, is the Church,
which is said to be the "New Israel". (Ja. 1:1; Gal. 4:26; Eph. 2:19; Apo. 21:2
etc.) The Kingdom is formed by "priests", just as v. 6 says. (Apo. 1:6; 1 Pet.
2:9.)
