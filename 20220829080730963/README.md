# The Woman in Apo. 12 is the Church

link: https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101988027

+ WT thinks the woman is not the Church, but the "Heavenly Organization"
+ Main reason is the distinction between God and Christ.
  + The bride of Christ is the Church
  + If Yahweh is not Christ, then their wife can't be the same
+ There's no indication the there are two brides in the whole book of Apo.

+ par. 11-12: WT identifies the boy as Christ, according to Psalm 2.
  + Christ uses the image of Psalm 2, earlier, to refer to those who "win".
  + the detail is that the WT thinks it regards the Kingdom of Christ, though
    the book of Apo. clearly shows that He was a King already.
