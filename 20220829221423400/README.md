# Christ as the Cloud-Rider in Apo. 1:13

> then in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed
> with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.

Christ appears as the "Son of Man" --- reference to Dan. 7 ---, where the
"Cloud-Rider" figure receives His dominion from the Ancient of Days. (Dan.
7:13-14.) This is confirmed by Apo. 1:5, where Christ is sasid to be "the
King of Kings of the Earth". He made His followers a "Kingdom", in which they
participate by being in union with Christ. (Apo. 1:9.) Christ also is wearing
priestly clothes, a parallel stablished with Psalm 110, where He is called High
Priest.
