# Maybe John's Apocalypse was originally written in Hebrew

I once heard John's Apocalypse's Greek is really bad. If it was written by the
apostle himself, then it might be reasonable to assume that he, as a jew,
wouldn't be the best Greek writer. But there's another hypothesis that came to
my mind that I can't really confirm with my current knowledge, neither I know
what resources to use to try to attest it. That is: was it written originally in
Hebrew and then translated in a posterior time?

1. I have one passage, in particular, that is in mind: Apo 21:3. It talks about
   God residing with humanity, and some commentaries say it seems to be
   referring to the name Emmanuael, which is attributed to Christ and means "God
   among us". Not all translations will render something that is reminescent of
   this, but some do. If so, it would be reasonable to assume that, in the
   translation process, the basic text structure was lost trying to translate
   the name, but the translator tried to maintain its core meaning.
1. Another thing, which I got from Stephen De Young's book, "Religion of the
   Apostles", is that the expression "Lord God", which occurs a lot of times in
   the text of Apocalypse, is a parallel of the OT's expression "Yahweh God". If
   it has a Hebrew origin, than the translation consistently would show a
   similar pattern, as it does. I can't think of other "hebrewisms", but there
   may be others.
1. It's also very noticible that there are lots of OT parallels, e.g., Ezekiel's
   throne and Apo. 4's throne; Daniel parallels [got to ellaborate more];
   Isaiah's parallels [got to ellaborate more].
